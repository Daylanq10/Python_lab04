## PROBLEM : Ask a user for input that describes a certain number, calculate the
##          remainders, output the number the user had in mind
##
## ALGORITHM : 
##      1. Loop for continuity
##      2. Tell user to think of number
##      3. Ask for reminders when modulus 3, 5, and 7
##      4. Calculate number that matches modulus's given
##      5. Output number
## 
## ERROR HANDLING:
##      Should be handled to take all invalid inputs
##
## OTHER COMMENTS:
##      Thank you for helping with the number thing is makes sense
